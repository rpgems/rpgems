# Stack Definition

## Local development

For local development, we'll be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

 - One container will have the database engine and data
 - One container will have the backend service running
 - One container will have the frontend service running

We'll use a `docker-compose.yml` file that will be responsible to orchestrate the environment required to run this system

## Python package management

We'll use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package and dependency management.

## Frontend management

TBD
